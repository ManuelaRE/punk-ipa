# punk-api


## React project

1. Use of public API to implement search functionality. I used React Hooks to earch and display beers by their name. Also, the checkbox enables filtering the reply.

2. Use of Firebase authentification with Google to log in.

## Development server
Run yarn start for a dev server. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 

## Ways to further develop the app
Styling - make the app fully responsive.
